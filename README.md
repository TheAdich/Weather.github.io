Lets talk about my Fav project->The Weather-App
Language Used:HTML5 CSS JAVASCRIPT
Features of this App
1.) Web Page opens up with a loading animation
2.) Web browser will ask the user to give permission to fetch his/her geolocation position
3.) if user permits the web page will show the user his/her location weather details with related background image and each time the background image changes according to weather-updates if the user again reload its web page
4.) if somehow the user denied its permission the web page will take the user to my github site where you can see my source code of this project.

Note: The user Infrormation is not stored in any way.We respect Your Privacy.
Any kind of suggestion/feedback/more ideas to this project are highly welcomed:)
